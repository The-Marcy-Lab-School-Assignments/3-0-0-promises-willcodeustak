# Question

Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise');
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer

console.log('Outside promise') would print first because it is synchronous.

Promise.resolve would be waiting on the promise to be fulfilled. Also "then.(console.log) means that it will console.log AFTER confirmation of fulfillment so that gives it away as not printing first over a straight up "console.log('Outside promise')".
