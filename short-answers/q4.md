# Question

with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer

The arguments that you pass into resolve/reject go through the process of verifying fulfillment/successful which is then put into the resolve step.

The reject function is used to mark the Promise as rejected. The value passed to reject becomes the reason for the rejection, often an error object or an error message.
