# Question

With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()` âˆš

It does not matter if you return a value. It not not mandatory.

If the promise contains resolved, it will call its .then handler with a value.

When a Promise is resolved, it will always provide a "result" value.

vis versa if rejected it will always return a reasoning for error.

b. calling _and_ returning them X
