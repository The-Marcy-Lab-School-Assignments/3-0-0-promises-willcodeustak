# Question

What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer

.then is the process for what to do AFTER fulfillment
aka promise resolves successfully THEN returns a value or whatever else you want.

.catch is rejecting since it is not what you want or within the parameters that you specified.
aka the promise fails with an error. You can access the error information returned in the catch method of the promise.
